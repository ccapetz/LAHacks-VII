    <h1>Deep Learning Models</h1>
    <h3>Natural Disaster Damage Assessment</h3>
    <p>Process</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilized a dataset of 10,000 aerial images depicting individual homes and other structures affected by
            Hurricane Harvey to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</li>
        <li>Applied the trained CNN model to larger scale images that contained multiple structures</li>
        <li>Integrated the machine learning model with a web application, enabling real-time classification of new
            imagery for disaster assessment purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Impact</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enables first responders to quickly and accurately assess the damage caused by hurricanes and other natural
            disasters (as opposted to manually labelling data)</li>
        <li>Improves the overall effectiveness of disaster response efforts, potentially saving lives and reducing
            property damage</li>
    </ul>

            <h3>Land Use and Cover Map Generation</h3>
            <p>Process</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The LULC identification model was trained on satellite imagery sourced from EuroSAT and Google Earth
                    Engine, using RGB image classification. The result was a model which allows the user to request
                    satellite images from certain regions, segment the image into 64x64 chunks, and use the LULC model
                    to accurately label them.</li>
                <li>A GeoJSON file is returned with the predicted labels, which is then visualized using kepler.gl.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Impact</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In combination with the LULC maps, the two models allow for a user-friendly view of land usage in
                    order to assess risk and potential improvements for future urban development.</li>
            </ul>
